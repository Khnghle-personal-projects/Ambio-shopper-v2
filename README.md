# Amibo-Shopper

## Deployed Site

* http://amibo-shopper.herokuapp.com/cart

## Purpose

* Amibo-shopper is a responsive e-commerce site which that allows users view a catalog of different amibos, add certain products to their cart and checkout. This is a recreation of a group project from Fullstack Academy, which aims tests my understanding of making a Fullstack application using React, Sequelize, Express and Redux from a solo developers purspective. Our original project was created in 9 days, and lacked pagination, search, google OAuth and Stripe capabilities. This project as practice during my fellowship, as I would have to teach the stack to other students. I hope you enjoy it!

## Features

* Stripe enabled
* All product view with pagination and search bar
* Login/log-out and Google OAuth
